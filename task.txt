I have completed the task that you have given me. 
I have  done these features:
    1. show books
    2. pagination
    3. wishlist (with toggle button)
    4. wishlist page
    5. books details page

What API did you provide me, its do respond very slowly. 
That is why, I stored books in localStorage after the API
call and showing from there.I did not do the pagination 
through the API query due to the API being slow.
I have taken the data from the local area.
